# Financial-Performance-Analysis-of-S-P-500-Companies
End-to-end data analysis project exploring the financial performance of S&amp;P 500 companies. I used Python (Pandas) for data cleaning and metric calculation, and Power BI for creating an interactive dashboard. This project demonstrates skills in data processing, financial analysis, and professional reporting.
