# Financial-Performance-Analysis-of-S-P-500-Companies
This is an end-to-end data analysis project focusing on the financial performance of S&P 500 companies.

It demonstrates my skills in the full data analysis lifecycle:

Data Sourcing & Preparation: Using Python and the Pandas library, I processed and cleaned raw financial data.

Financial Analysis: I calculated key profitability metrics, including Gross, Operating, and Net Profit Margins.

Business Intelligence: I designed and built an interactive dashboard in Power BI for advanced visualization and reporting.

This project showcases my ability to translate complex financial data into actionable insights and professional, shareable reports.

How to Run the Project
1. Open Financial_Dashboard.pbix for PowerBI dashboard
   or
2. Open PowerBI template
2a. Open the financial_dashboard.pbit file.
2b. Power BI will prompt you to select the data source.
2c. Use cleaned_profitability_for_powerbi.csv file as data source.
2d. The dashboard will load with all the visualizations and filters ready for exploration.
